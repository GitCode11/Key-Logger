# Key-Logger

Keystroke logging, often referred to as keylogging or keyboard capturing, is the action of recording (logging) the keys struck on a keyboard,
typically covertly, so that the person using the keyboard is unaware that their actions are being monitored.

This is a sample CPP code that implements a Key Logger.

To run this,

On an offline CPP Complier ( I used CodeBlocks), run this file.

In the directory where your all codes are saved, you will find a .exe file with same name.

Run that .exe file. Your Key Logger has started.

Now it will store all you Key Stroke Presses in a .txt file.

To stop it, go to task manager and Search for KeyLogger.exe under running background processes.
